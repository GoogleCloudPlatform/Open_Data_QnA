class ResponseAgent(Agent, ABC):
    """
    An agent that generates natural language responses to user questions based on SQL query results.

    This agent acts as a data assistant, interpreting SQL query results and transforming them into user-friendly, natural language answers. It utilizes a language model (currently Gemini) to craft responses that effectively convey the information derived from the data.

    Attributes:
        agentType (str): Indicates the type of agent, fixed as "ResponseAgent".

    Methods:
        run(user_question, sql_result) -> str:
            Generates a natural language response to the user's question based on the SQL query result.

            Args:
                user_question (str): The question asked by the user in natural language.
                sql_result (str): The result of the SQL query executed to answer the question.

            Returns:
                str: The generated natural language response.
