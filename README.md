<h1 align="center">Open Data QnA - Chat with your SQL Database</h1> 

‚ú® Overview
-------------
The **Open Data QnA** python library enables you to chat with your databases by leveraging LLM Agents on Google Cloud.

Open Data QnA enables a conversational approach to interacting with your data. Ask questions about your PostgreSQL or BigQuery databases in natural language and receive informative responses, without needing to write SQL. Open Data QnA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between human language and database queries, streamlining data analysis and decision-making.

**Key Features:**

* **Conversational Querying with Multiturn Support:** Ask questions naturally, without requiring SQL knowledge and ask follow up questions.
* **Table Grouping:** Group tables under one usecase/user grouping name which can help filtering your large number tables for LLMs to understand about.
* **Multi Schema/Dataset Support:** You can group tables from different schemas/datasets for embedding and asking questions against.
* **Prompt Customization and Additional Context:** The prompts that are being used are loaded from a yaml file and it also give you ability to add extra context as well
* **SQL Generation:** Automatically generates SQL queries based on your questions.
* **Query Refinement:** Validates and debugs queries to ensure accuracy.
* **Natural Language Responses:** DRun queries and present results in clear, easy-to-understand language.
* **Visualizations (Optional):** Explore data visually with generated charts.
* **Extensible:** Customize and integrate with your existing workflows(API, UI, Notebooks).


It is built on a modular design and currently supports the following components: 

### Database Connectors
* **Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL**
* **Google BigQuery**
* **Google Firestore(for storing session logs)**

### Vector Stores 
* **PGVector on Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL**
* **BigQuery Vector Store**

### Agents 
* **BuildSQLAgent:** An agent specialized in generating SQL queries for BigQuery or PostgreSQL databases. It analyzes user questions, available table schemas, and column descriptions to construct syntactically and semantically correct SQL queries, adapting its process based on the target database type.
* **ValidateSQLAgent:** An agent that validates the syntax and semantic correctness of SQL queries. It uses a language model to analyze queries against a database schema and returns a JSON response indicating validity and potential errors.
* **DebugSQLAgent:** An agent designed to debug and refine SQL queries for BigQuery or PostgreSQL databases. It interacts with a chat-based language model to iteratively troubleshoot queries, using error messages to generate alternative, correct queries.
* **DescriptionAgent:** An agent specialized in generating descriptions for database tables and columns. It leverages a large language model to create concise and informative descriptions that aid in understanding data structures and facilitate SQL query generation.
* **EmbedderAgent:** An agent specialized in generating text embeddings using Large Language Models (LLMs). It supports direct interaction with Vertex AI's TextEmbeddingModel or uses LangChain's VertexAIEmbeddings for a simplified interface.
* **ResponseAgent:** An agent that generates natural language responses to user questions based on SQL query results. It acts as a data assistant, interpreting SQL results and transforming them into user-friendly answers using a language model.
* **VisualizeAgent:** An agent that generates JavaScript code for Google Charts based on user questions and SQL results. It suggests suitable chart types and constructs the JavaScript code to create visualizations of the data.

**Note:** the library was formerly named Talk2Data. You may still find artifacts with the old naming in this repository.

üß¨ Repository Structure 
-------------
Details on the Repository Structure can be found [`here`](/docs/repo_structure.md) in the docs. 


<!-- üèÅ Getting Started: Quick Start   
-------------
**NOTE: THIS IS STILL v1 - UPDATING THE STANDALONE NOTEBOOK TO v2 IS WIP**

**Quickstart with Open Data QnA: [Standalone BigQuery Notebook](/notebooks/(standalone)Run_OpenDataQnA.ipynb)**

Copy both [Standalone BigQuery Notebook](/notebooks/(standalone)Run_OpenDataQnA.ipynb) and [pyproject.toml](/pyproject.toml)

This notebook offers a streamlined way to experience the core functionality of Open Data QnA using BigQuery as both the data source and vector store. While it doesn't encompass the full flexibility of the repository setup, it's a perfect starting point to quickly test and explore the conversational querying capabilities of Open Data QnA with your own BigQuery datasets.  -->


üèÅ Getting Started: Main Repository 
-------------
‚ÑπÔ∏è **You can setup this solution with two approaches. Choose one based on your requirements:**
  - **A)** Using Jupyter Notebooks (For better view at what is happening at each stage of the solution)
  - **B)** Using CLI (For ease of use and running with simple python commands, without the need to understand every step of the solution)


### Clone the repository and switch to the correct directory 
   
    git clone git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/Open_Data_QnA.git
    cd Open_Data_QnA
__________

### A) Jupyter Notebook Based Approach

#### 1. Run the [1_Setup_OpenDataQnA](/notebooks/1_Setup_OpenDataQnA.ipynb) (Run Once for Initial Setup) 

This notebook guides you through the setup and execution of the Open Data QnA application. It provides comprehensive instructions for configuring your environment, preparing the vector store.

#### 2. Run the [2_Run_OpenDataQnA](/notebooks/2_Run_OpenDataQnA.ipynb)

This notebook guides you by reading the configuration you setup with [1_Setup_OpenDataQnA](/1_Setup_OpenDataQnA) and running the pipeline to answer questions about your data.

#### 3. [Loading Known Good SQL Examples](/notebooks/3_LoadKnownGoodSQL.ipynb)
   
   In case you want to separately load Known Good SQLs please run this notebook once the config variables are setup in config.ini file. This can be run multiple times just to load the known good sql queries and create embeddings for it.

___________

### B) Command Line Interface (CLI) Based Approach

#### 1. Add Configuration values for the solution in [config.ini](/config.ini)

For setup we require details for vector store, source database etc. Edit the [config.ini](/config.ini) file and add values for the parameters based of below information.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Follow the guidelines from the [config guide document](/docs/config_guide.md) to populate your [config.ini](/config.ini) file.

**Sources to connect**

- This solution lets you setup multiple data source at same time.
- You can group multiple tables from different datasets or schema into a grouping and provide the details
- If your dataset/schema has many tables and you want to run the solution against few you should specifically choose a group for that tables only

**Format for data_source_list.csv**

**source | user_grouping | schema | table**

**source** - Supported Data Sources. #Options: bigquery , cloudsql-pg

**user_grouping** - Logical grouping or use case name for tables from same or different schema/dataset. When left black it default to the schema value in the next column

**schema** - schema name for postgres or dataset name in bigquery 

**table** - name of the tables to run the solutions against. Leave this column blank after filling schema/dataset if you want to run solution for whole dataset/schema

Update the [data_source_list.csv](/scripts/data_source_list.csv) according for your requirement.

Note that the source details filled in the csv should have already be present. If not please use the Copy Notebooks if you want the demo source setup.

Enabled Data Sources:
* PostgreSQL on Google Cloud SQL (Copy Sample Data: [0_CopyDataToCloudSqlPG.ipynb](0_CopyDataToCloudSqlPG.ipynb))
* BigQuery (Copy Sample Data: [0_CopyDataToBigQuery.ipynb](0_CopyDataToBigQuery.ipynb))

#### 4. Run [opendataqna.py](/opendataqna.py) to run the pipeline you just setup

The Open Data QnA SQL Generation tool can be conveniently used from your terminal or command prompt using a simple CLI interface. Here's how:

```
python opendataqna.py --user_question "What are the top 5 cities with highest recalls?" --user_grouping "fda_food"
```

Where

*session_id* : Keep this unique unique same for follow up questions.

*user_question* : Enter your question in string

*user_grouping* : Enter the BQ_DATASET_NAME for BigQuery sources or PG_SCHEMA for PostgreSQL sources (refer your [data_source_list.csv](/scripts/data_source_list.csv) file)


**Optional Parameters**

You can customize the pipeline's behavior using optional parameters. Here are some common examples:
```
# Enable the SQL debugger:
python opendataqna.py --session_id="..." --user_question "..." --user_grouping "..." --run_debugger

# Execute the final generated SQL:
python opendataqna.py --session_id="..." --user_question "..." --user_grouping "..." --execute_final_sql

# Change the number of debugging rounds:
python opendataqna.py --session_id="..." --user_question "..." --user_grouping "..." --debugging_rounds 5

# Adjust similarity thresholds:
python opendataqna.py --session_id="..." --user_question "..." --user_grouping "..." --table_similarity_threshold 0.25 --column_similarity_threshold 0.4

```
